# Studio Ghibli Movie App

This application uses the API https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films
to list the movies made by Studio Ghibli and allows the user to click on a 
specific movie to retrieve more information about each movie. This application is run on a single html file and does not use redirects.
